        "content":"The mare flattened her ears against her skull and snorted, throwing up earth with her hooves; she didn’t want to go.  Geralt didn’t calm her with the Sign; he jumped from the saddle and threw the reins over the horse’s head.  He no longer had his old sword in its lizard-skin sheath on his back; its place was filled with a shining, beautiful weapon with a cruciform and slender, well-weighted hilt, ending in a spherical pommel made of white metal.\nThis time the gate didn’t open for him.  It was already open, just as he had left it.\nHe heard singing.  He didn’t understand the words; he couldn’t even identify the language.",
